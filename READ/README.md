In this GIF, we witness how an AI is learning to play a basketball game.

#### Dataset(s) or libraries?

Despite its apparent simplicity, our Pong AI project strategically employs datasets and libraries. The core library, "Pygame," lays the foundation for the Pong environment, enabling the creation of a visually engaging and interactive setting. Additionally, "sklearn" facilitates AI calculations, while "Numpy" handles numerical operations. The balanced use of these tools showcases a meticulous approach tailored to the project's requirements.

#### Algorithme?
A standout feature of my project is the incorporation of a simple yet effective AI algorithmâ€”linear regression. This intentional choice aligns with the project's objectives. Linear regression, valued for its simplicity and interpretability, fits scenarios where a linear relationship is assumed between input(the current location of the ball) and output(the location that the ball is heading to, influenced by the speed). In our context, it establishes a correlation between the ball's x-position and the CPU paddle's y-position.

### Linear Regression Unveiled:
Why Linear Regression? 

Its simplicity and interpretability make it suitable when anticipating a linear correlation.
Application in Pong: The linear regression model predicts CPU paddle movement based on the ball's current position. It empowers the model to make informed predictions, injecting dynamism into the CPU paddle's response.
This deliberate use of linear regression serves as an educational example, demonstrating the application of machine learning principles in basic gaming environments. While the project introduces linear regression, real-world applications may demand more complex algorithms based on problem intricacies.

#### Relevant tools?

The project leverages widely adopted tools in the programming community:

Python: A versatile and powerful language serving as the backbone for implementing game logic, algorithme and AI.

#### Target/inference?

The primary inference goal revolves around predicting CPU paddle movement based on the ball's current position. The linear regression model, meticulouslydynamically adjusts the CPU paddle's behavior, adding responsiveness and challenge to the game.



#### Hardware?

The project's hardware requirements are modest, demonstrated by its development on a MacBook. Standard PCs or desktops can effortlessly run this undemanding project, ensuring accessibility to a broader audience.


#### Software/ OS?

The project's software ecosystem centers around Visual Studio Code, a widely embraced code editor known for its versatility. While development occurred on MacOS, the project's compatibility ensures seamless execution across diverse operating systems, enhancing accessibility.

#### Software deployement?

Given the project's simplicity, deploying it as an .exe file emerges as an optimal solution. This streamlined approach ensures straightforward execution on various platforms, reflecting a commitment to user-friendly deployment.

(NOTE: An attempt of implementing the project in to an .exe file can be find in this reposetory, but it isn't functional.)

## Results

After the meticulous process of creating the Pong AI, let's delve into a comprehensive reflection on the results and the key components that shape the game.

The main parts of this game are:

1. The enviroment
2. The paddle
3. The control display
4. The ball
### The enviroment
![foto1](foto1.png)

By using Pygame, I could create the iconic look of the Pong game.
### The paddle
The paddle of the player can be moved using the up- &#8595; or down- &#8593;
keys on your keyboard. The ball will bounce off any side of the screen if it hits a wall. If you score a point by hitting the wall.
It is not possible to move the ball with the mouse. This means that the only way to control the direction of the ball is the keyboard. The left paddle is controlled by the PC/CPU.

### The control display

![controldisplay](control.png)

The control display acts as the informational hub of the game, offering insights into crucial aspects of gameplay. The display includes the player's score, providing immediate feedback on their performance. The current ball speed, which indicating the ball's speed, introduces an intriguing dynamic to the game and score Tracking. We will discuss these features in depth.

Score Tracking

The score is prominently displayed next to the player's name, offering a clear and constant reference point. Each successful hit on the opponent's wall results in a point, dynamically altering the score.

Speed Dynamics

At the heart of the control display lies the dynamic indicator of the ball's speed. This intentional design choice introduces a gradual increase in speed as the game progresses. The speed factor adds an element of challenge, keeping players engaged and responsive to the evolving difficulty.

### The ball

The ball, as the primary entity in the game, undergoes dynamic interactions with paddles and walls. Its speed, a critical parameter, evolves throughout the game, intensifying the challenge. If the ball makes contact with the walls behind the paddles, the scoreboard undergoes timely adjustments.
## Future Directions and Expansion

While the current iteration of the Pong AI project provides a solid foundation, there are avenues for expansion and enhancement:

1. AI Paddle Complexity
Currently, the AI-controlled paddle operates with a basic algorithm. Future iterations could explore more sophisticated AI techniques, introducing adaptive strategies based on player behavior.

2. Game Customization
Introducing features like customizable ball speed, paddle sizes, or game modes could add depth to the gaming experience. Such customization options cater to diverse player preferences.

3. Multiplayer Functionality
Expanding the game to accommodate multiplayer interactions could elevate the competitive aspect. Whether locally or online, multiplayer functionality would amplify the social dimension of the game.

4. Visual and Audio Enhancements
Consideration for visual and audio enhancements, from more polished graphics to engaging sound effects, can contribute to a more immersive gaming atmosphere.
