## Introduction

This project is a thesis for the module AI-Programming by William Rogov. For this thesis I have chosen to make and integrate an AI to the populair and timeless game "Pong".

## Goals
#### Main-Goal
The main goal of this project, is to create a Pong A.I that moves the paddle accordingly to defeat the player (you).
#### Sub-Goals
The Sub-Goals for this project differ in alot of ways, here is a small list of potential Sub-Goals:

1. Making a working envirement (playingfield, paddles etc...)
2. Making a working AI (AI-Player)
3. Programming the controls
4. Making a working scoreboard
5. ...

## Problem statement

#### 1. The main problem?
The primary problem we aim to tackle is the creation of an artificial intelligence capable of playing Pong at an advanced level. This involves understanding the game's rules, making strategic decisions, and enhancing performance. Despite the seemingly simple nature of Pong, it poses a challenge for AI due to the need for rapid responses to changing conditions.

#### 2. Social context?
In the societal context, the project contributes to the ongoing advancement of artificial intelligence. The ability to play Pong serves as a test case for the development of intelligent systems capable of handling more complex tasks, such as autonomous vehicles, medical diagnoses, or the analysis of large datasets.

#### 3. Target audience?
The target audience for this project includes researchers and developers in the field of artificial intelligence, as well as the broader community interested in the progress of AI technologies. By creating an AI that can play Pong, we contribute to the understanding of enhancements of the capabilities of AI in various application domains.
